About the Project

This app was created for training purposes. Clicking on any item will start playing a YouTube video titled "Junior Developer Interviews in 2025 Be Like." It’s a funny video—though some might find it hilarious, others might find it less amusing (personally, I find it a bit less entertaining, but it was added as a fun feature to make the app more interactive).
